-- GitFocus
-- 
-- by:
--  - Ryan Dotson:       original scripts, editing and documentation
--  - Rosemary Orchard:  issue content and author extraction, 'Show in OmniFocus'
--
-- Version 1.0.3
-- 9 January 2020
--
-- <https://github.com/nostodnayr/gitfocus>
--
-- This script takes a GitLab/GitHub issue or merge request open in front Safari window
-- and creates an action in OmniFocus with a note including a link and the text of
-- the item.
--
-- This AppleScript relies on two Perl scripts to get the work done. They are:
--
--    + gitfocus-sorter.pl: Determines which project the action is sorted into
--    + gitfocus-titler.pl: Prettifies the action title
--
-- IMPORTANT
-- The sorter script must be edited by you to suit your needs. Instructions for doing
-- so can be found in that script.
--
-- To use, copy all three scripts to ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Safari/
-- I trigger the script with a keyboard shortcut assigned through FastScripts
-- (to the AppleScript, not the Perl scripts).
--
-- The script will try to handle itself gracefully, and if the item doesn't match
-- a project you've specified or isn't a GitLab/Hub page, it should open the Quick Entry
-- window with the page information filled.
--
-- Known Limitations: - The script may behave unexpectedly if you have multiple projects
--                      with the same name.
--                    - If you are using a self-hosted GitLab instance that doesn't have
--                      'gitlab' in the URL, the script will not attempt to extract
--                      the author or title. Edit the _page_url conditional block below
--                      to suit your needs.
--                    - Author name and issue text may fail if GitLab or GitHub change
--                      their markup.
